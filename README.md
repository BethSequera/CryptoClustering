# Cryptocurrency Clustering Project

## Overview
This project aims to cluster cryptocurrencies based on their price change percentage over different time intervals. We use K-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to group cryptocurrencies with similar price trends. This README provides an overview of the project, instructions to run the code, and explanations of the key components.

## Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

- `crypto_market_data.csv`: A CSV file containing cryptocurrency market data, including price change percentages over different time intervals.
- `crypto_clustering.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the entire project workflow, including data loading, preprocessing, clustering, and visualization.
- To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crypto-clustering.git

cd crypto-clustering
```
2. Install the required dependencies (if not already installed):
```
pip install pandas hvplot scikit-learn
```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook
4. Execute each cell in the notebook to load, preprocess, cluster, and visualize the cryptocurrency data.

## Results
The project results include the following:

- Clustering of cryptocurrencies using K-means with the optimal number of clusters.
- Visualization of the clusters using scatter plots.
- Dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
- Clustering of cryptocurrencies using K-means with PCA components.
